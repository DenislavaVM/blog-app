# Blog Platform

## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack blogging platform that allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts. The platform includes user authentication, enabling users to register, log in, and interact with content through actions such as liking and commenting on posts. Guests can browse posts but must register to participate in any interactive activities.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration, login, and logout functionality using JWT.
- **CRUD Operations**: Full CRUD operations for blog posts, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts.
- **User Roles**: 
  - **Guest Users**: Can browse the catalog and view post details.
  - **Registered Users**: Can create posts, like, and comment.
  - **Authors**: Can edit and delete their own posts.
- **Responsive UI**: The interface is built with React and styled using external CSS files.
- **RESTful API**: Backend API built with Express.js and MongoDB.
- **Client-side Routing**: Implemented with React Router, providing a seamless navigation experience.
- **Component-based Architecture**: The frontend is modular, using React components for maintainability and scalability.
- **Form Validation and Error Handling**: Ensures a robust user experience by handling errors gracefully.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For managing client-side routing.
- **Context API**: For managing global state across the application.
- **CSS**: For styling components and ensuring responsive design.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used to store user and post data.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM library for MongoDB, providing schema validation and query building.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Used for securing user authentication.
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling file uploads, such as post images.


## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the server directory and install server dependencies:

cd blog-app/server
npm install

3. Navigate to the client directory and install client dependencies:

cd ../client
npm install

Environment Setup
1. Server Environment Variables:

In the server directory, create a .env file and add the following environment variables:

MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=yourjwtsecret

* Replace <username>, <password>, and <dbname> with your MongoDB Atlas credentials or your local MongoDB setup.

2. Client Environment Variables:

In the client directory, create a .env file and add the following environment variable:

REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

## Running the Application
1. Start the MongoDB server:

    * If you're using MongoDB locally, ensure your MongoDB service is running.
    * If using MongoDB Atlas, make sure your cluster is active and accessible.

2. Start the Backend Server:

    * In the server directory, run the following command to start the Express server:

    npm start

    * The backend server will start on http://localhost:5000 by default.

3. Start the Frontend Server:

    * In the client directory, run the following command to start the React development server:

    npm start

    * The frontend will start on http://localhost:3000 by default.

4. Access the Application: 

    * Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view and interact with the application.
